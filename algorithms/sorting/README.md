# Sorting Algorithms
The classical sorting algorithms:

- **`Bubble Sort:`** "swaps adjacent elements"
  > __invariant__: the last element of the current subarray is the 
greatest element after checking every pair (after each iteration).

- **`Selection Sort:`** "select the smalest element and place it in the beginning"
  > __invariant__: the first element 
of the current subarray is the smallest element after each iteration.

- **`Insertion Sort:`** "places (inserts) an unsorted element at its suitable place"
  > __invariant__: for each 
iteration the unsorted element is placed at its correct position.

- **`Merge Sort:`**
  > `TODO:` Add algorithm descriptions and invariant when add it's implementation. 

- **`Quicksort`**
  > `TODO:` Add algorithm descriptions and invariant when add it's implementation.
